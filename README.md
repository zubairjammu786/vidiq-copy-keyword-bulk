# vidiq-copy-keyword-bulk
Chrome Extention which can copy and export multiple / bulk keywords from vidiq keyword page.

VidIQ free version doesn't support copy multiple keywords and export them to csv. So i have made this extention which can do that job. You just have to search your keyword and click copy button which will be appeared on keyword research page of vidiq after installing this extention. You can search and copy hundreds and thousands of keywords by searching and then hitting copy button and at the end you can also export csv file .
